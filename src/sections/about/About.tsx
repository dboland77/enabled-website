      Dave Boland is a distinguished professional with a background in actuarial science and
      insurance risk modelling. With 15 years of experience, Dave has driven innovative risk
      assessment initiatives that enhance financial stability. He graduated top of his class in
      Computer Science and Mathematics, earning an award from the university President for
      maintaining a GPA above 3.5. Dave's academic credentials include serving as a senior lecturer
      and programme director at Queen Mary University of London, where he developed and delivered a
      module for the Master's in Business Analytics. Known for his analytical prowess and attention
      to detail, Dave excels in crafting sophisticated models that ensure accuracy. As an autistic
      individual with sensory needs and communication differences, Dave found traditional workplaces
      largely inaccessibleâ€”a challenge faced by 65% of disabled individuals in the UK. He chose
      entrepreneurship to create solutions that ensure future generations, including his own
      children, never encounter these barriers.
